# There are videos to install Matlab R2014b on Ubuntu 14.04. However, in case there appears to be a problem 
# with java, with file libjli.so, you need to find its' location. 
# For that you type in the terminal (or any other command you know to locate the file):

ls -l $(locate libjli.so)

# the output was like this for me:

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 56072 abr 24 22:10 /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/amd64/jli/libjli.so

# For some reason this is not what we need. So to install Matlab you go to your Matlab folder 
# with file "install" and, as a root, type in the terminal:

./install -javadir /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-amd64/jre/

# Then you proceed with installation instructions. For it worked fine.
